<h1 id="Dada-Mail-Changelog-for-v9.x">Dada Mail Changelog for v9.x</h1>

<h1 id="pod9.1.2">9.1.2</h1>

<p>This is mostly a bug-fix release, fixing bugs found in the v9.1.2 release.</p>

<p>Of note were several minor bugs found in the Installer - some of which are documented below, but other small bugs include:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Bounce Handler always being enabled to be installed</p>

</li>
<li><p>The, &quot;Hide Administration Link&quot; always set, even if the option is not enabled.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Changes">Changes</h2>

<h3 id="Mandrill-API-support-dropped">Mandrill API support dropped</h3>

<p>Mandrill has changed their ToS to disallow bulk mailing, so this service is a bad fit for something like Dada Mail. We&#39;ve removed the API to streamline the underlying codebase.</p>

<h3 id="Amazon-SES-docs-expanded">Amazon SES docs expanded</h3>

<p>We love Amazon SES! We&#39;ve updated and expanded the docs to help you better set up Amazon SES in Dada Mail. Docs can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://dadamailproject.com/d/features-amazon_ses_support.pod.html">http://dadamailproject.com/d/features-amazon_ses_support.pod.html</a></p>

<h3 id="Ping-Test-in-Sending-Options-Test-for-SMTP">Ping Test in Sending Options Test for SMTP</h3>

<p>We&#39;ve added a simple ping test to see if the host at the port you&#39;ve specified can be reached. Many times, problems sending via SMTP are because the outgoing port on the server Dada Mail is installed on is blocked, rather than the SMTP credentials being wrong, or there&#39;s a bug in Dada Mail. This small enhancement will help clarify where the problem may be.</p>

<h3 id="Added-.htaccess-file-in-dada-directory">Added .htaccess file in, &quot;dada&quot; directory</h3>

<p>We&#39;ve added a simple .htaccess file in the main <b>dada</b> directory to set the DirectoryIndex to the mail.cgi script. That way, one can just visit,</p>

<pre><code>        http://example.com/dada
        </code></pre>

<p>and will see Dada Mail&#39;s default screen instead of nothing, or the underlying directory structure.</p>

<h1 id="pod9.1.21">9.1.2</h1>

<p>This is mostly a bug-fix release, fixing bugs found in the v9.1.1 release.</p>

<h2 id="Bugfixes1">Bugfixes</h2>

<h3 id="Incorrect-.htaccess-in-the-dada-extensions-directory">Incorrect .htaccess in the dada/extensions directory</h3>

<p>There was an errant .htaccess file in the dada/extensions directory, disallowing access to any of the directory contents, including extensions you may have been running. This has been removed!</p>

<h3 id="Mailhide-encode-sometimes-fails-with-strange-input">Mailhide encode sometimes fails with strange input</h3>

<h3 id="https:-github.com-justingit-dada-mail-issues-546">https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/546</h3>

<p>This is a very strange, and quite large bug. It basically affects anything where you need an email sent for Profile work: registering, retrieving a new password, etc,</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/546">https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/546</a></p>

<h3 id="Dada-3---4-utility-script-was-broken">Dada 3 -&gt; 4 utility script was broken</h3>

<p>Looks like the following script was not working for v9 of Dada Mail:</p>

<p>Lhttp://dadamailproject.com/d/dada3_to_dada4_sql.pl.html&gt;</p>

<p>This script is still useful, if you&#39;re upgrading from v3 of Dada Mail, are using the SQL backend, and also have profile fields. We&#39;ve updated it to work correctly with v9.</p>

<h3 id="Subscription-forms-in-Dada-Mail-using-JSONP-rather-than-JSON">Subscription forms in Dada Mail using JSONP, rather than JSON</h3>

<p>Dada Mail&#39;s subscrption forms that you see on the default screen, as well as the list screen&#39;s now use JSONP in the background to do their work. This is to workaround Same Origin Policies, that even effect calls from diffrent subdomains of the same domain (ie: example.com and www.example.com)</p>

<h2 id="Changes1">Changes</h2>

<h3 id="Disabling-IP-Check-in-List-Control-Panel-sessions">Disabling IP Check in List Control Panel sessions</h3>

<p>By default, Dada Mail will look at the IP address that a user is said to be logged in from, and compare it to the IP address in the session data. If they do not match, the session will fail, and you will be booted out of the session.</p>

<p>Sometimes, this does not work as expected, so we&#39;ve now allowed you to disable this feature:</p>

<p>In the Installer under, <b>Advanced Configuration</b>, check, <b>Configure Security Options</b>. Then, <i>uncheck</i> the option, <b>Check for Matching IP Addresses</b>. Done!</p>

<h1 id="pod9.1.1">9.1.1</h1>

<p>This is mostly a bug-fix release, fixing bugs found in the v9.1.0 release - of note, we broke the Tracker plugin, with the v9.1.0 release. We&#39;ve also added some additional .htaccess files in directories of Dada Mail that you may not want snooping in.</p>

<h2 id="Bugfixes2">Bugfixes</h2>

<h3 id="Tracker-plugin-does-not-run">Tracker plugin does not run</h3>

<p>https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/543</p>

<h1 id="pod9.1.0">9.1.0</h1>

<h2 id="Features">Features</h2>

<h3 id="Save-to-Multiple-Lists-at-Once">Save to Multiple Lists at Once</h3>

<p><b>Previously:</b> One frustration of working with a large collection of different mailing lists with Dada Mail is that each mailing list must be administrated one at a time, so it was not possible to make changes to mailing list settings fo all mailing lists at once.</p>

<p><b>Now:</b> with v9.1.0, we&#39;ve introduced the ability to saving List Settings to multiple mailing lists at once.</p>

<p>The following list control panel screens support this feature:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Mass Mailing - Options</p>

</li>
<li><p>Membership - Options</p>

</li>
<li><p>Sending - Options</p>

</li>
<li><p>Sending - Mass Mailing Options</p>

</li>
<li><p>Archives - Options</p>

</li>
<li><p>Archives - Advanced Options</p>

</li>
<li><p>Appearance - Email Message Template</p>

</li>
<li><p>Appearance - HTML Screen Template</p>

</li>
<li><p>Plugins/Extensions - Tracker</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>To use this feature, log into a mailing list with your <b>Dada Root Password</b>, otherwise the feature will not be available. Look for the button labeled, <b>Save For Multiple Lists...</b>. When clicked, a modal window will open allowing you to select the mailing lists that you would like to save the list settings for that list control panel to.</p>

<p>By default, all the available mailing lists are selected, but you may customize this if you would like.</p>

<h2 id="Bugfixes3">Bugfixes</h2>

<h3 id="Login-Switch-links-sometimes-hit-server-security-filters">Login Switch links sometimes hit server security filters</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/542">https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/542</a></p>

<h3 id=""></h3>

<h1 id="pod9.0.3">9.0.3</h1>

<p>This is mostly a bug-fix release, fixing bugs found in the v9.0.2 release</p>

<h2 id="Changes2">Changes</h2>

<p>We&#39;ve made some changes in the <b>Membership - View</b> screen to make loading a bit more apparrent, stopping the user from guessing if things are working correctly. We&#39;re utilizing a JavaScript library called, spin.js (<a href="http://spin.js.org/">http://spin.js.org/</a>) to help out on making the loading screen. Thanks, min.js!</p>

<p>We&#39;ve also made similar changes to the Tracker plugin&#39;s default screen, as well as preloading some of the easier-to-create data before the rest of the data is availabl. Crunching the numbers to show the table of analytics may take a while, if you have busy lists! Now, you&#39;ll have access to the individual message reports before the index report is ready.</p>

<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>

<p>This is mostly a bug-fix release, fixing bugs found in the v9.0.0 + v9.0.1 release</p>

<h2 id="Changes3">Changes</h2>

<h3 id="Amazon-SES-Automatic-Batch-Settings">Amazon SES Automatic Batch Settings</h3>

<p>Dada Mail can set up your Batch Settings for your mailing list automaticaly, using your daily quota, and per-second limits set by Amazon SES. It does so fairly conservatively. This works - but for the majority of users, it could work better. So, we&#39;ve made our automatic batch settings send at a more aggressive speed, having it taper it&#39;s speed back, as you come closer to your set quota.</p>

<p>Expect <i>10x speed up</i> for mass mail sending if you haven&#39;t used any of your daily Amazon SES quota. And we&#39;re not joking.</p>

<h2 id="Bugfixes5">Bugfixes</h2>

<h3 id="Send-a-Webpage-and-Plaintext-Messages">Send a Webpage and Plaintext Messages</h3>

<p>Dada Mail&#39;s Send a Webpage screen was initially envisioned to send out HTML-formated mailing list messages fetched via a URL. Users have said that they would like to use the same functionality to send PlainText-formatted messages. But when they try, Dada Mail complains about a missing HTML version of the webpage.</p>

<p>Dada Mail should now have proper support to explicitly NOT set an HTML version of a message, as well as the ability to correctly send a PlainText version of a message, without requiring an HTML version.</p>

<p>Setting a Plainted scheduled message with the Send a Webpage screen will also work correctly. Dada Mail should correctly sense if the PlainText version has been modified since the last mass mailing has been sent, and skip over a scheduled mass mailing (if you have set things up to do so).</p>

<h3 id="Quoted-Replies-not-formatted-correctly-in-public-archives">Quoted Replies not formatted correctly in public archives</h3>

<p>Discussion messages usually show some, or all of the original message they&#39;re replying to. Dada Mail formats this reply, so that it&#39;s easier to distiguish the reply, from the original message - just like your mail reader. This functionality seems to have been missing in v9 of Dada Mail, as the needed style was removed.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve changed this functionality, so that quoted text shown in the public archives are simply wrapped in blockquote HTML tags.</p>

<h3 id="File-Attachments">File Attachments</h3>

<p>In certain situations, file attachments were not properly being sent with mass mailings. We&#39;ve done some work to ameliorate this problem. This problem may be related to the updated version of the Core 5 Filemanager that we ship with Dada Mail, and how it handles handing back the name of the file you have uploaded and selected.</p>

<h3 id="Admin-login-if-no-mailing-lists-are-public">Admin login if no mailing lists are public</h3>

<p>If all your mailing lists are private, the admin screen shows NO popup menu to select your list, as well as a button labeled, &quot;More...&quot; that you can press to get a textbox to enter in your list shortname. This is silly.</p>

<p>Now, if the above scenario is in place, you&#39;ll see a textbox.</p>

<h3 id="SQL-Options-in-Dada-Mail-Installer-when-SQL-is-not-available">SQL Options in Dada Mail Installer when SQL is not available</h3>

<p>Dada Mail requires the Perl driver for the SQL backed you would like to use. If none are available, the included Installer will simply not show any options, which will confuse the user into thinking that no backend configuration is needed, rather than perhaps allude to the fact that one of those required drivers needs to be separately installed. This should now be fixed.</p>

<h3 id="Caching-of-js-and-css-files">Caching of js and css files</h3>

<p>Browsers love to cache files, like cascading style sheets and javascript files.</p>

<p>This is usually a very good idea! But, some users have been having trouble when upgrading Dada Mail, as the browser is using older versions of these files, breaking their just-upgraded Dada Mail. To help this problem, we&#39;re adding a simple query string to the end of the URLs for .css and .js files (that aren&#39;t already versioned), so that cache-hungry browser will use a new version of the file, when a user upgrades their Dada Mail.</p>

<h1 id="pod9.0.0">9.0.0</h1>

<p>Initial release of v9. Hurray!</p>

<p>This release introduces a new visual look, feel, and functionality to Dada Mail&#39;s Front End, thanks to the utilization of the Zurb Foundation Front End Framework:</p>

<p><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">http://foundation.zurb.com/</a></p>

<p>Big wins to using the Foundation Framework are:</p>

<h3 id="Removal-of-Crufty-HTML">Removal of Crufty HTML</h3>

<p>Dada Mail is a mature application, first written in 1999. Some of the HTML used for formatting was still relying on tables. Still! Almost all table-based layouts have now finally been removed, being replaced using Foundation&#39;s Grid Layout System:</p>

<p><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/grid.html">http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/grid.html</a></p>

<p>Tables are still used, but usually only for tabular data.</p>

<h3 id="Responsive-Design">Responsive Design</h3>

<p>Dada Mail takes full advantage of Foundation&#39;s support for Repsonsive Design, especially in the List Control Panel. That means you can more easily and comfortably use Dada Mail on your phone or tablet - the design will adapt to your screen&#39;s available real estate. For example: The List Control Panel&#39;s top bar menu will be hidden off-canvas if you&#39;re viewing on a phone device, but can be revealed via a hamburger menu on the upper left side of the toolbar menu.</p>

<h3 id="Todo">Todo</h3>

<p>At this point, we have not heavily customized Dada Mail&#39;s design - the app right now has the same look and feel of the default styling of Foundation. Future releases will move towards refining Dada Mail&#39;s own design. To do this, we will be utilizing Foundation&#39;s SASS workflow:</p>

<p><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html">http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html</a></p>

<h2 id="Features1">Features</h2>

<h3 id="One-Click-Unsubscribe">One-Click Unsubscribe</h3>

<p>One-Click Unsubscribe has been reintroduced into Dada Mail in a much more secure form, as well as now being smart enough to know when the unsubscribe link has been visted by an actual user or an app that is scanning the received message and then following all links found within.</p>

<p>For the former, unsubscription will truly be one-click. Our technique relies on Javascript - if Javascript is not available, the previous method will be shown: displaying a form for the subscriber to fill out with their email address.</p>

<h3 id="Enhanced-Mailing-List-Login-Security">Enhanced Mailing List Login Security</h3>

<p>Dada Mail now records the IP Address from a successful login. If this IP Address changes through a session, the session will be invalidated, and the user will be required to log in again.</p>
