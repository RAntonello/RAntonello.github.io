Dear SC members,=0D
=0D
I hope you are all getting this email, and do not find the use of a =0D
mailing list intrusive. It should be convenient, and not receive more =0D
traffic than the volume of SC-related email that have been exchanged in =0D
the past. You can email the list simply by sending an email to =0D
steering@itcs-conf.org.=0D
=0D
A preliminary draft of the ITCS website is available at itcs-conf.org. =0D
The goal of the website is to serve as a "permanent home" for ITCS. =0D
Something people will easily find by googling, will contain a little =0D
background on the conference, links to prior instantiations, =0D
proceedings, a link to the local conference website (or it could also =0D
easily host it directly), etc.=0D
=0D
I am seeking any kind of feedback and comments. Some specific points to =0D
consider are:=0D
=0D
- General design. This will hopefully get improved (in particular I =0D
would like a little color - which color is ITCS? Red (as was ICS)?), but =
=0D
suggestions are welcome.=0D
=0D
- "The ITCS Conferences" text on the home page. This was previously =0D
labeled "mission statement" but I decided to be less forceful. The text =0D
is mostly plagiarized from statements on past ITCS websites, and some =0D
original text Umesh had forwarded me. We can definitely change it, so =0D
let me know if you're not comfortable with it.=0D
=0D
- Pictures in the Governance tab. Let me know if you're not happy with =0D
yours.=0D
=0D
- Mailing list. As suggested by Madhu, I created an =0D
announcements@itcs-conf.org list. The aim is to use this as one (among =0D
others) ways of communicating with anyone interested in the conference. =0D
CCC has a similar list. It has very low traffic, maybe 3-4 email a year, =
=0D
e.g. to announce when the new CFP is out, suggest registration when it =0D
is set up, point to the proceedings once they are out, and perhaps one =0D
or two other general announcements.=0D
=0D
Thanks for taking the time to send your feedback!=0D
Thomas=0D
=0D
PS: Technically, the website is hosted by bluehost.com and =0D
designed/managed through wordpress. I can give direct access to anyone =0D
if you would like to (same for the mailing list platform). I bought the =0D
domain and basic hosting services for a year, at a cost of 70$. This is =0D
renewable yearly for about the same cost (it is a little less if I sign =0D
up for linger). So it is basically a negligible cost, and I am happy to =0D
cover it for the foreseeable future :-) (Unless there are ethical =0D
reasons not to do so...this is taken out of my personal Caltech funds.)

Hi Leslie,=0D
=0D
Thanks for the explanations! If it was only up to me I would go with the =
=0D
second license you suggest, authorizing re-use but in entirety, as =0D
things taken out of context can always appear, well, out of context.=0D
=0D
I don't have strong feelings about this though and don't want to clash =0D
with Delft's standard. We have to use the same, right? Or could I use =0D
simply use the "no clips" license for my own videos? If so, and it's =0D
simple to implement, let's do it. If it created complications, let's not =
=0D
worry about it and use the license suggested by Delft.=0D
=0D
Thanks!=0D
